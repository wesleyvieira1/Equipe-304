                <p>Climate can be defined as the state of balance in a system of exchanges of thermodynamic properties between different compartments. The ocean plays a climate regulation role thanks to its heat capacity. It releases heat more slowly and helps balance the temperature differences between regions.</p>
                <p>Rising temperatures cause ocean acidification, reducing their ability to absorb and retain carbon. As a result, marine life is negatively impacted and harmed by human actions, such as emitting tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) daily.</p>
                <p>An example of this acidification occurred in American Samoa between December 2014 and February 2015, as shown in the image available on The Ocean Agency's website.</p>
