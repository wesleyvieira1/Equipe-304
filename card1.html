                <p>One of the main functionalities of algae for society's life is its ability to convert carbon dioxide, much of it produced by humans themselves, <br>
                     into oxygen, which is a vital gas for the population. This process will be described below, step by step, along with an image.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Algae contain photosynthetic pigments, such as chlorophyll, which are located in cells. These pigments capture sunlight.</li>
                        <li>Algae absorb carbon dioxide from the environment, which is one of the main reactants in photosynthesis.</li>
                        <li>Using the energy of sunlight captured by chlorophyll, algae undergo a series of complex chemical reactions <br>
                             that take place in organelles called chloroplasts. These reactions convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen.</li>
                        <li>The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released into the environment as a byproduct. This oxygen is essential for the <br>
                             respiration of many organisms on Earth, including humans</li> 
                    </ol>
