                <p>A significant portion of our food and export recipes depends on climate and water. The ocean is interconnected with river water, the rain cycle, and the regulation of the planet's climate, and a major contributor to this balance is algae, which serve as food for various species of fish. Therefore, for these algae to be suitable for the consumption of these fish, promoting health and good conditions for reproduction, the ocean needs to be favorable with the right temperature and oxygen levels, conditions that algae can provide to the ocean. This entire system benefits the lives of the fish, allowing them to reach fishermen and eventually our tables, providing high-quality food to humans and driving the economy through the sale of this product</p>
